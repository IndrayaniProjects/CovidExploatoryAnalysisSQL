This repository is dedicated to the exploratory analysis of Covid Deaths, infections and Vaccinations.
The data is analysed countrywise, datewise.
We can explore and have many new insights through running the SQL Scripts.

This is also and oppotrtuny for me to put my SQL skills to work and explore the Data in relevance to UAE and the world.
The data is very very close to real.

The data was extraced from excel files CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations (Both the files are uploaded in the same repository for reference and actually trying the scripts). Microsoft import export wizard is used for importing excel file data to Microsoft SQL Server management Studio. Local server was used to run the scripts.
